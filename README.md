# YaRouter

YaRouter is (yet another) PHP router. It's built to be simple and easy to use with minimal configuration.

It does one thing only. It routs URI/URL requests (Such as: `https://example.com/foo`) to a view/template (Such as: `/path/to/view/foo.html`). Keeping your URLs clean and friendly!

## Installation

Via composer.json

```
{
    "require": {
        "digi-brains/ya-router" : "<a specific release or 'dev-master'>"
    }
}
```
